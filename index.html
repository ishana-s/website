            <p> Human activity, from hunting to hiking, can create a landscape of fear that causes wildlife to shift their temporal activity away from humans. Most predator-prey couples maintain a small amount of temporal overlap, but these shifts can push a prey's cycle further into a predator's activity cycle. Conversely, more human-fearing predators might be completely separated from their main prey's cycle and must switch to another prey.
